      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently pursuing my final year Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Electrical(Major) and in Data Science(Minor) at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani - Hyderabad campus. I am a Google certified Associate Android and have many Andorid applications published on Google Play store. I have been developing software applications for more than three years and have also contributed to open source oraganisations and have a good grasp over programming languages like Java, C++, Python, Dart and Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from software development, my research interests include Program analysis and machine learning. I have an IEEE publication in the same topic. I have some experience of working with tools like Radare2, Binary Ninja, KLEE for binary analysis and Tensorflow for Deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
